        <h3>What's a grilled cheese sandwich?</h3>
        <p>The grilled cheese is a hot cheese sandwich typically prepared by heating slices of cheese between slices of bread with a cooking fat such as butter or mayonnaise on a frying pan, griddle, or sandwich toaster, until the bread browns and the cheese melts.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>White bread</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Preheat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Generously butter one side of a slice of bread. Place bread butter-side down in the hot skillet; add 1 slice of cheese. Butter a second slice of bread on one side and place butter-side up on top of cheese.</p></li>
            <li><p>Cook until lightly browned on one side; flip over and continue cooking until cheese is melted. Repeat with remaining 2 slices of bread, butter, and slice of cheese. </p></li>
