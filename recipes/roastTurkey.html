        <h3>What is a Roast Turkey: </h3>
        <p>A turkey being basted during cooking in a turkey roaster. Roast turkey—the preparation of the whole bird as a meal for a large group of people—has a long tradition in North America that dates back to the time when wild turkeys were shot to be roasted on campfires.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (18 pound) whole turkey</li>
            <li>½ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove turkey neck and giblets. Rinse turkey and pat dry with paper towels, and place breast-side up, on a rack in a roasting pan.</li>
            <li>Loosely tent turkey with aluminum foil, and roast turkey for 2 1/2 hours, basting with pan juices every 30 minutes. When drippings evaporate, add remaining stock to the pan, 1 to 2 cups at a time.  </li>
            <li>Remove foil and continue roasting until a meat thermometer inserted in thickest part of thigh reads 165 degrees F (75 degrees C), about 1 1/2 hours more. </li>
        </ol>
